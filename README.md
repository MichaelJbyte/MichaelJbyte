- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelJbyte
- 👀 I’m interested in running scripts to simplify security protocols.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ Certificate. I will also be learning python via lietcode & codehs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to upload scripts and document processes to prove I can understand scripts. I will also upload any projects that I may take on.
- 📫 You can easily reach me by emailing: mickjets@gmail.com
- ⚡ F̶u̶n fact: It's cornhole, not bean bag toss.
